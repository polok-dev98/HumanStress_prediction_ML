# HumanStress prediction simple machine learning project.

# About this project:
1. Perform text preprocessing such as cleaning, stemming, stop words removes, null values check etc.

2. Apply Tf-idf for building the word embeddings vector or features.

3. Apply many ML models such as LR, RF, MNB, AdaBoost, DT, KNN etc for training compare the accuracay and F1 score.
